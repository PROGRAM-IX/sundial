Sundial 
=======
SDL, OpenGL and C++ Game Framework
----------------------------------

**Sundial** is a game framework that uses SDL for events, OpenGL for drawing and C++ for code. It aims to obviate the need for sprites, using instead 'vector sprites' constructed of points in space, joined by lines. I would like to redefine 'programmer art' as something to be proud of.

**Sundial** is an attempt to take the ideas used in my previous game framework, **PyStroke** (https://github.com/PROGRAM-IX/pystroke), and implement them using a language (C++) and a drawing library (OpenGL) more able to handle fast handling of many vector lines.
